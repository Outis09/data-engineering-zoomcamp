This directory contains my answers and codes for the homework of Module 01.

The homework can be accessed [here](https://github.com/DataTalksClub/data-engineering-zoomcamp/blob/main/cohorts/2024/01-docker-terraform/homework.md).

The homework required ingesting two different datasets into postgres using Docker. My codes for that can be found in the [ingest data](ingest-data.ipynb) Notebook.
