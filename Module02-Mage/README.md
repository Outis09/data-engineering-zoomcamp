### Mage ðŸŽ©ðŸŽ©ðŸŽ©

For Module 2 of the zoomcamp, Mage was taught.

In this module I learned to build pipelines on Mage.

I built pipelines that do the following:
 - Read data from an API, transforms the data, and writes it to a postgres database
 - Read data from an API, transforms the data, and writes it to a Google Cloud Storage bucket
 - Read data from an API, transforms the data, and writes it to BigQuery
 - Read data from a Google Cloud Storage bucket, transforms the data, and writes it to BigQuery

The files I used to create these pipelines are contained in the subdirectories.

After the zoomcamp, I'm looking to dive more into deployment, triggers and alerts on Mage. For now I will just try to build projecst with the knowledge I have.

I feel like a magician ðŸŽ© already
