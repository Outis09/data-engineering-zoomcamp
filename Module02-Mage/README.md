##### Mage ðŸŽ©ðŸŽ©ðŸŽ©

For Module 2 of the zoomcamp, Mage was treated.

In this module I learned to build pipelines on Mage.

I built pipelines that did the following:
 - Reads data from an API, transforms the data, and writes it to a postgres database
 - Reads data from an API, transforms the data, and writes it to a Google Cloud Storage bucket
 - Reads data from an API, transforms the data, and writes it to BigQuery
 - Reads data from a Google Cloud Storage bucket, transforms the data, and writes it to BigQuery

The files I used to create these pipelines are contained in the subdirectories.

In the future, most likely after the zoomcamp, I'm looking to dive more into deployment, triggers and alerts on Mage. For now I will just try to build projecst with the knowledge I have.

I feel like a magician ðŸŽ© already
